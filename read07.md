# How JavaScript makes webpages more interactive

1. Access content :you can acess text, p , image and any html element for example.
   - **select text inside all h1 elements on page**
2. Modify content :You can use JavaScript to add
           elements, attributes, and text to the
               page, or remove them. 
               **For example** 
               1. _Add a paragraph of text after the_
               _first hl element_
               2. _Change the value of c 1 ass_
               _attributes to trigger new CSS rules_
               _for those elements_
3. **PROGRAM RULES**
_You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe),which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:_
##### A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.

#### expressions in JavaScript :**an expression evluates into a result in a single value**
1. _EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE :_
   **the assignment operator the eqal sign exapmle: var name = 'yaseen'**
2. _EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN SINGLE VALUE_
   **perform an action to the value and then sign it again example : var num = 2+4**

## operator's in JavaScript :
  1. **assignnment operators: var name = 'yaseen' so the equal sign is the assingnment oprator here**
  2. **comparison operator's : var by = 3 < 5 the less than operator here is the operator and we can do whole the compaarison**
  3. **arthematic operator : var buy = 2+4 so the arthematic operator here is+**
  4. **logical operator : var buy = (4<5) && (5>3) so the logical operator here is the and operator**
  
  
 ## Functions in javascript :Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

## How can you make a function on javascript :
  **Fuction functionName (parameter ,parameter){**
  **series of statment such as : declaring variable and doning calculation**
  **return theProcessedVale**
  **}**
  
 ## we call the function like this: FunctionName();
