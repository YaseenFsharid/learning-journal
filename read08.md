# Compersion amd logical operatrs and loops
## Compersion  & logical operators 
**Comperison operaotr evaluating conditions like :**
  + **the doubled sign operatores == means that when we makeing this style of assignment the result whould be through this condition**
     - example : _"hello" == "goodbye"_ **the result is false cause it is not the same string so the == chech the validity inside the assiged string**
  + **the not equal operator != means that it checks if the two string are not equal to each other it will return true other wise it return false**
     - example : _"Heloo" != "goodbye" and this is the most important to know cause if we tried "helo" != "helo" it will return false_
  + **three equal sign === it chech if the two strings has the same datatype and text like this**
     - example : _"hello" === "hello" will return true cause the both has the same datatype and the same value_
  + **the not equal equal operator !== : chech that the two string dose not have the same value or type**
     - example : _'4' !== 4 will return true cause the both dose not have the same type or value_
     
  ## Loops : loops is a way to repeat a sequantial lines of code by checking if the condition is true it will repeat and if its false it will 
  ## Stop excuting the block of code that repeated several time and there is three ways to makeing loops in javascript :
  1. **first way is whil loop :we using this approch if we did not know how many times should we repeat a block od code**
     - _the while loop have this structure_
     **while(condition){**
     **statment that you wanna repea ....**
     **counter increment like this i++**
     **}**
     _the counter inital value is declared above the loop by macking var i = 0;_
     
   2. **seconed way is the for loop and we use it when we know how many times we wanna make the loops **
      **the syntax of the for loop is like this :**
      **for(var i=0;condition  ; condition counter ++) { carly brackets**
      **sequantial statments**
      **}close carlyb brackets**
      - _so this is the style of for loop_
    3. **the third way is do while loop  : the defferance between while loop and do while loop is**
       **the statments in the code block coming befor the condition so that those statments are run once whether or not the condition is met**
       - the syntax of do while loop.
       **do {**
       **sequantial statments ... **
       **counter incremant or decrement ++ or --**
       **}(condition)**
