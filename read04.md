# structure web page with html 
## Every website should be designed for the
## target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the
## site owner. It is therefore very important to
## understand who your target audience is.
It can be helpful to ask some
*questions about the people you*
*would expect to be interested in*
*the subject of your site.*
*If you ask a client who a site is*
*for, it is not uncommon for them*
*to answer "the entire world."*
*Realistically, it is unlikely to be*
*relevant to everyone. If your site*
*sells light bulbs, even though*
*most people using a computer*
*probably use light bulbs, they*
*are not likely to order them from*
*someone in a different country.*
*Even if the site has a wide*
*appeal, you can still think about*
*the demographics of a sample of*
*the target audience.*

### best practice to do the structure is wireframes:
**wire frames is the way to draw your page and spacifies everything you wanna make on your website and wire frams is UI/UX design that makes everything goes easy **
