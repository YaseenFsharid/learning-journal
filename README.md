growth mindset
**gowth mindset for me is made by the experiance in people and sociaty and the gain of this thing can be handled under , hard working , and fabulous mentality that's gained from the connetion between me and the people , places , thoughts and face any challange easily by thinking about it outside the boks** .
 # there is  three important reminders to keep my self under growth mindset :
 ***1- keep calm and think about *biggest problem* as a simple thing .***
 ***2- keep your self at the challange phase which means that you can continuously learn from that .***
 ***3- make a fabulous goal -(big and worth )- thats pushing you to developing yourself to better and gain worth mind set.***
