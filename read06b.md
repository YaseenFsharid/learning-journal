# how computers work 
#### comuters have input, storage ,processores, output .
**inputs have many style like**
- head Phones
- playstations arms
- key baord ...etc

#### this inputes going to storage (memory) and then :
_computer processor take information from storage(memory) and make a series of commands called(algorithems)_
_and then get back to the computer memory agian until the processed information ready to be output_

#### the output actually can be games ,photos, virtual reaility and computer have a signals can even control a robot.
_with the internet output of a computer can be input to another one so this machine made one of the biggest revelution_

**HOW COMPUTERS WORK**
_data and binary computer works on zero's and one's_
_almost no body today actually deals with one & zero_
_but the computers do play a big role is how computers work_
_this is done by curcits and wires they carry all the information in the computer_
_and it store and represent the  information by wire_
_wire is a pipe(the smallest piece of informaion a computer can store)_
_on & off, zero & one,true &false _
_so wire represent the BIT in computer_
_which means more wires handle more bits with more bits you can represent more complex informaion_


#### The binary numbered system 
1. only have two digits 0,1
2. after each position its multiply with 2 and computer doing this math 
3. with more wires you use the more number you can store 

**example: 32 wires  store from zero to billion so you can represent any number you want**
_also computer represent text by zero & one cause the each letter has number_
_image also represent by zero and one cause the image has million of pixle each pixel represent color and each color has an number_
_this is the powerful technolog in these days_
