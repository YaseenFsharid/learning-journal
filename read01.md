# Learning MarkDown 
## What is Markdown?
## Markdown is a way to style text on the web. 
##You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, 
##adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, 
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### examples of markdown language 
1. **Headers** _we can make headres on mark down by butting hashtags befor the line of text it's equal to  h1 , two , three etc.._
2. **Lists** _we can make orderdList & unordered list _
  - _order list is done by putting for example 1.then 2. then three and so on_
  - _unordered list is done by putting - or + of * befor line of text_
3. **We can make links on markdown language for example**
  - [snapchat.com](https://www.snapchat.com/)
4. **we can make an image in mark down language**
  - ![car](the image address of car)
